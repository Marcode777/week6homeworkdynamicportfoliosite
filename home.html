      <li><strong>About Marco:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <p>Marco's first foray into "coding," as it were, happened when he kept an online journal (blog) during his late high school and college days. He found out that he could change the font colors, and background colors of his blog and even insert images onto it, by typing certain words inside "arrows" (tags). He thought this was an amazing process. Little did he know that this was actually coding in a markup language called HTML. He just thought it was amazing. It was just a hobby, and at the time, even though he wanted to learn more, he majored in the sciences in college and was unaware of how to pursue it more. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>Fast-forward about a decade and then some, Marco's budding hobby in dabbling in coding has grown into a full-fledged mission to learn how to create websites that are pleasing to the eye and that are fully functional. He is currently a student at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp (RCB). With the skills he learns from RCB, he plans on becoming a software developer, ready to create on the front-end, beautifully-designed, dynamic websites, and on the back-end fully functional systems, culminating in a full-stack set of skills. </p>
